array expenses stay in app.js
we need to create component which in the end
is responsilbe for rendering these 4 expense items =>
so this 4 expense items are no longer rendered in the app component;
the new component should be rendered in app js
we need the app js component leaner by extracting some jsx into 
separate new components and we need to use props to pass into
the new component 
wraps all the 4 expenses components in a div with a expenses class
